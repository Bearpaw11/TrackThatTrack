Track That Track (c) is a Desktop user-friendly music app, created by Christopher Behrens, Melanie Rogoff, Shauna McGrail, and Linzy Gilbreath.

This app was made for music lovers that are looking to learn more about bands/artists of their choosing. This app allows users (upon entering an artist name and clicking “search”) to find the following:

* Artist Bio and Facebook/BandsinTown Page Links (information courtesy of LastFM API & BandsInTown API)
* Artist Photo and Genre Tags (information courtsey of LastFM API)
* Upcoming Events (information courtesy of BandsInTown API)
* Similar Artists (information courtesy of LastFM API)


Track That Track (c) Value Proposition: 

* At this moment in time, music enthusiasts must utilize Google to find band information, and then go to outside apps to find their upcoming events. This app aims to provide both information, along with photographic forms of media, all in one app.
